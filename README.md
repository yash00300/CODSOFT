## 🧠 List of Projects & Descriptions

### 1. 🪨📄✂️ Rock Paper Scissors
**File:** `Rock_paper_scissors.py`

A simple CLI-based implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. The user plays against the computer, which randomly selects its move. The game keeps track of win/loss/tie outcomes based on the user's choices.

> ✅ Concepts used: `random`, `if-else`, `input/output`, loops

---

### 2. 📋 To-Do List
**File:** `To-Do_List.py`

A command-line To-Do list manager that allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks. Tasks can be stored persistently using a text or JSON file.

> ✅ Concepts used: file handling, lists, functions, menu-based interface

---

### 3. 🧮 Calculator
**File:** `calculator.py`

A basic calculator that supports arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes user input and performs operations based on selection.

> ✅ Concepts used: functions, arithmetic operations, input validation

---

### 4. 📞 Contact Book
**File:** `contact_book.py`

A simple contact management system where users can add, view, search, and delete contacts. Contacts can be saved in memory or to a file.

> ✅ Concepts used: dictionaries, search functionality, file I/O

---

### 5. 🔐 Password Generator
**File:** `password_gen.py`

Generates strong, secure passwords using a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. Users can specify the length and complexity of the password.

> ✅ Concepts used: `random`, `string`, user input, loops
